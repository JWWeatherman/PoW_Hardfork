# Effects of a single unexpected PoW change
Making a one-time change to proof of work 
would have different effects 
on different participants in the bitcoin ecosystem. 
Here we are assuming that concerns over centralization
of mining power
and the behavior of miners has created enough concern
to justify a proof of work change 
inorder to destroy the economic value of 
all existing specialized mining hardware.
Proposals to modify proof of work so that the mining hardware
is not completely worthless, but less valuable
will have the same effects,
but in proportion to the economic value removed 
by the change to proof of work.

## ASIC makers in early stages of development
If an ASIC maker has invested into developing 
hardware, but has not begun selling the hardware
or earning bitcoin fees by mining himself,
the entirety of his investment would be destroyed
with a PoW change.

This is true for both malicous and benevolent
ASIC makers, but if it could be determined
the ratio of malicous ASIC makers to benevolent ASIC makers
it is possible that the change could be timed 
inorder to have a greater impact on malicous makers. 

However, chip manufacturing is highly secretive,
and determining intent is very difficult
(especially with brand new entrants).
As a result of these, and other challenges,
no mechanism has been identified to reliably
determine the ratio of malicous to benevolent 
ASIC maker investments that would be destroyed
through a PoW change at a given point in time.

## ASIC makers with products near end of life
If an ASIC maker has made investments in hardware
that is nearing obsolescence
by the creation of more effecient hardware,
they would actually benefit from a PoW change.

This is because their competitors would be harmed
finanically to the degree that they have investments
that have not returned capital,
whereas their own investments have already returned
capital and are no longer producing additional revenue.

It may be easier to determine makers with products
nearing end of life to avoid harming them with financial loss
with a PoW change,
but those makers are in the best position to know
how they would be effected and when a change would be most helpful.
And we still lack a mechanism for reliably determining their
future intent.

## Miners with newer specialized hardware
Miners will be finanically damaged by a PoW change
in proportion to the investments that they have made
in mining hardware and facilities that will become
unprofitable as a result of a PoW change.

Miners with the most recent investments,
new competitors,
would be harmed the most
because they have not had the opportunity to earn
mining rewards and fees using the new hardware.

## Miners with newer facilities investments
It is possible that facilities could be reused 
since they are not directly effected by a PoW change,
however cooling, electrical, and space requirements
could be drastically effected with a PoW change.

To the degree to which these facilities are no longer
as ideal, due to a PoW change,
the miner will suffer financial loss.

The newest facilities will be the most likely
to be optimally designed for the current generation 
of mining hardware,
and therefore will be the most likely to suffer loss.

## Miners with older specialized hardware
Miners with hardware nearing obsolescene 
would benefit from a PoW change.
This is because their competitors,
would be damaged finanically
(the best equiped competitors would be harmed the most)
while they would not suffer financial loss.

## Physical and administrative centralization
If a great majority of the existing mining hardware 
is under the control of a few people,
or is physically located in a small number of places,
a PoW change could result in greater decentralization 
(a larger number of indiviudals with administrative control
and a larger number of physical locations).

This would be a security improvement
because it would make 
physical attacks on the network
and the individuals managing the network,
more more difficult.

Unfortunately this is not guaranteed.

For example consider a large organization
who's business is being disrupted by bitcoin.
Before the PoW change they would have needed to
make a large investment in hardware
that is only useful 
as long as bitcoin maintains market value.

But after the PoW change they could use hardware
that could be useful to their business, 
or resold later,
to attack bitcoin.
If this business maintains a large number of servers
that are idle except durring peak usage hours
the costs are even lower.

In this example, 
and others,
it is possible that mining could become more centralized 
after a PoW change.

The authors are unaware how to measure the liklihood 
of increased or decreased centralization immediately 
following a PoW change.

## Resistance to physical and administrative centralization
Immediately after a PoW change
it is possible that physical and administrative 
centralization would be reduced,
however it would also make bitcoin ASIC soft.

Currently bitcoin mining equipment
is operating at the height of human capability
using 10 nm and below chipsets specifically designed
to mine bitcoin as effeciently as possible.
A PoW change would reduce bitcoin mining efforts 
to more generic, and less efficient, mining hardware.

As a result a well funded miner 
could invest in ASIC hardware 
and gain a disproportonate amount of control over the network.
This is believed to be the source of 
centralization problems as of Q1 2018.

This illustrates the importance of reaching commoditization
of state of the art hardware. 
Attackers would need to advance the state of the art
of microprocessors, 
not just bitcoin miners,
in order to obtain an advantage over the network.
This is far more expensive
and would be far more difficult 
to accopmlish and maintain in secret.


## Resistance to malicous mining attacks

Changing the PoW would have 
three major effects on the networks resistance
to malicous mining attacks.

First, an attacker could invest
in mining hardware and gain a disproportionate 
amount of power of the network.
So, while it is possible that the immediate effect
of a PoW change would be physical and administrative decentralization,
it would certainly make it much easier for a well funded
attacker to create a high degree of centralization before executing his attack.

Second, it would lower the hardware cost
involved in malicous mining attacks.
For example an attacker could,
rent hardware from a clound server provider,
such as Amazon EC3,
for only long enough to execute his attack.
This is far less expensive than purchasing hardware
that will be less valuable in proportion to the success of the attack.

Finally, it would greatly increase the possibility 
of an attacker discovering a flaw in the PoW algorithim
that would allow him to attack the network by faking work.
Changing security critical components always
introduce significant risk.
The existing PoW algorithim has enjoyed
the benefit of nearly a decade of attack and analysis,
including the identification of vulnerabilities
not discovered until after deployment.
