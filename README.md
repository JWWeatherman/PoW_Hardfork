# Effects of a single unexpected PoW change
Making a one-time change to proof of work 
would have different effects 
on different participants in the bitcoin ecosystem. 
Here we are assuming that concerns over centralization
of mining power
and the behavior of miners has created enough concern
to justify a proof of work change 
inorder to destroy the economic value of 
all existing specialized mining hardware.
Proposals to modify proof of work so that the mining hardware
is not completely worthless, but less valuable
will have the same effects,
but in proportion to the economic value removed 
by the change to proof of work.

## ASIC makers in early stages of development
If an ASIC maker has invested into developing 
hardware, but has not begun selling the hardware
or earning bitcoin fees by mining himself,
the entirety of his investment would be destroyed
with a PoW change.

This is true for both malicous and benevolent
ASIC makers, but if it could be determined
the ratio of malicous ASIC makers to benevolent ASIC makers
it is possible that the change could be timed 
inorder to have a greater impact on malicous makers. 

However, chip manufacturing is highly secretive,
and determining intent is very difficult
(especially with brand new entrants).
As a result of these, and other challenges,
no mechanism has been identified to reliably
determine the ratio of malicous to benevolent 
ASIC maker investments that would be destroyed
through a PoW change at a given point in time.

## ASIC makers with products near end of life
If an ASIC maker has made investments in hardware
that is nearing obsolescence
by the creation of more effecient hardware,
they would actually benefit from a PoW change.

This is because their competitors would be harmed
finanically to the degree that they have investments
that have not returned capital,
whereas their own investments have already returned
capital and are no longer producing additional revenue.

It may be easier to determine makers with products
nearing end of life to avoid harming them with financial loss
with a PoW change,
but those makers are in the best position to know
how they would be effected and when a change would be most helpful.
And we still lack a mechanism for reliably determining their
future intent.

## Miners with newer specialized hardware
Miners will be finanically damaged by a PoW change
in proportion to the investments that they have made
in mining hardware and facilities that will become
unprofitable as a result of a PoW change.

Miners with the most recent investments,
new competitors,
would be harmed the most
because they have not had the opportunity to earn
mining rewards and fees using the new hardware.

## Miners with newer facilities investments
It is possible that facilities could be reused 
since they are not directly effected by a PoW change,
however cooling, electrical, and space requirements
could be drastically effected with a PoW change.

To the degree to which these facilities are no longer
as ideal, due to a PoW change,
the miner will suffer financial loss.

The newest facilities will be the most likely
to be optimally designed for the current generation 
of mining hardware,
and therefore will be the most likely to suffer loss.

## Miners with older specialized hardware
Miners with hardware nearing obsolescene 
would benefit from a PoW change.
This is because their competitors,
would be damaged finanically
(the best equiped competitors would be harmed the most)
while they would not suffer financial loss.

## Physical and administrative centralization
If a great majority of the existing mining hardware 
is under the control of a single person,
or is physically located in a small number of places,
a PoW change could result in greater decentralization 
(a larger number of indiviudals with administrative control
and a larger number of physical locations).

This would be a security improvement
because it would make 
physical attacks on the network
and the individuals managing the network,
more more difficult.

Unfortunately this is not guaranteed.
It is concievable that a well funded 
malicous actor could make a large investment 
in mining hardware that would have been 
impossible before a PoW change.

For example consider a large organization
with large numbers of generic processors.
It is possible that such an organization
could not fund a massive investment in hardware
that would become useless if their attack upon
the bitcoin network was successful 
at making the value of bitcoin drastically drop.

However, if this organization uses generic processors
for other uses it is concievable that it would be
cost effective to temporarily redirect
this equipment to attack the bitcoin network
and return it to regular service after the attack is completed.

This type of attack could have 
a much lower risk for the attacker
than specialized hardware and facilities.
