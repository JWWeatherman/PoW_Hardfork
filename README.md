# Effects of a single unexpected PoW change
Making a one-time change to proof of work 
would have different effects 
on different participants in the bitcoin ecosystem. 
Here we are assuming that concerns over centralization
of mining power
and the behavior of miners has created enough concern
to justify a proof of work change 
inorder to destroy the economic value of 
all existing specialized mining hardware.
Proposals to modify proof of work so that the mining hardware
is not completely worthless, but less valuable
will have the same effects,
but in proportion to the economic value removed 
by the change to proof of work.

## Specialized hardware makers in early stages of development
If an specialized hardware maker has invested into developing 
hardware, but has not begun selling the hardware
or earning bitcoin fees by mining himself,
the entirety of his investment would be destroyed
with a PoW change.

This is true for both malicous and benevolent
specialized hardware makers, but if it could be determined
the ratio of malicous specialized hardware makers to benevolent specialized hardware makers
it is possible that the change could be timed 
inorder to have a greater impact on malicous makers. 

However, chip manufacturing is highly secretive,
and determining intent is very difficult
(especially with brand new entrants).
As a result of these, and other challenges,
no mechanism has been identified to reliably
determine the ratio of malicous to benevolent 
specialized hardware maker investments that would be destroyed
through a PoW change at a given point in time.

## Specialized hardware makers with products near end of life
If an specialized hardware maker has made investments in hardware
that is nearing obsolescence
by the creation of more effecient hardware,
they would actually benefit from a PoW change.

This is because their competitors would be harmed
finanically to the degree that they have investments
that have not returned capital,
whereas their own investments have already returned
capital and are no longer producing additional revenue.

It may be easier to determine makers with products
nearing end of life to avoid harming them with financial loss
with a PoW change,
but those makers are in the best position to know
how they would be effected and when a change would be most helpful.
And we still lack a mechanism for reliably determining their
future intent.

## Miners with newer specialized hardware
Miners will be finanically damaged by a PoW change
in proportion to the investments that they have made
in mining hardware and facilities that will become
unprofitable as a result of a PoW change.

Miners with the most recent investments,
new competitors,
would be harmed the most
because they have not had the opportunity to earn
mining rewards and fees using the new hardware.

## Miners with newer facilities investments
It is possible that facilities could be reused 
since they are not directly effected by a PoW change,
however cooling, electrical, and space requirements
could be drastically effected with a PoW change.

To the degree to which these facilities are no longer
as ideal, due to a PoW change,
the miner will suffer financial loss.

The newest facilities will be the most likely
to be optimally designed for the current generation 
of mining hardware,
and therefore will be the most likely to suffer loss.

## Miners with older specialized hardware
Miners with hardware nearing obsolescene 
would benefit from a PoW change.
This is because their competitors,
would be damaged finanically
(the best equiped competitors would be harmed the most)
while they would not suffer financial loss.

## Physical and administrative centralization of bitcoin
If a great majority of the existing mining hardware 
is under the control of a few people,
or is physically located in a small number of places,
a PoW change could result in greater decentralization 
(a larger number of indiviudals with administrative control
and a larger number of physical locations).

This would be a security improvement
because it would make 
physical attacks on the network
and the individuals managing the network,
more more difficult.

Unfortunately this is not guaranteed.

For example consider a large organization
who's business is being disrupted by bitcoin.
Before the PoW change they would have needed to
make a large investment in hardware
that is only useful 
as long as bitcoin maintains market value.

But after the PoW change they could use hardware
that could be useful to their business, 
or resold later,
to attack bitcoin.
If this business maintains a large number of servers
that are idle except durring peak usage hours
the costs are even lower.

In this example, 
and others,
it is possible that mining could become more centralized 
after a PoW change.

The authors are unaware how to measure the liklihood 
of increased or decreased centralization immediately 
following a PoW change.

## Bitcoin's resistance to physical and administrative centralization
Immediately after a PoW change
it is possible that physical and administrative 
centralization would be reduced,
however it would also make bitcoin specialized hardware soft.

Currently bitcoin mining equipment
is operating at the height of human capability
using 10 nm and below chipsets specifically designed
to mine bitcoin as effeciently as possible.
A PoW change would reduce bitcoin mining efforts 
to more generic, and less efficient, mining hardware.

As a result a well funded miner 
could invest in specialized hardware hardware 
and gain a disproportonate amount of control over the network.
This is believed to be the source of 
centralization problems as of Q1 2018.

This illustrates the importance of reaching commoditization
of state of the art hardware. 
Attackers would need to advance the state of the art
of microprocessors, 
not just bitcoin miners,
in order to obtain an advantage over the network.
This is far more expensive
and would be far more difficult 
to accopmlish and maintain in secret.


## Bitcoin's Resistance to malicous mining attacks

Changing the PoW would have 
three major effects on the networks resistance
to malicous mining attacks.

First, an attacker could invest
in mining hardware and gain a disproportionate 
amount of power of the network.
So, while it is possible that the immediate effect
of a PoW change would be physical and administrative decentralization,
it would certainly make it much easier for a well funded
attacker to create a high degree of centralization before executing his attack.

Second, it would lower the hardware cost
involved in malicous mining attacks.
For example an attacker could,
rent hardware from a clound server provider,
such as Amazon EC3,
for only long enough to execute his attack.
This is far less expensive than purchasing hardware
that will be less valuable in proportion to the success of the attack.

Finally, it would greatly increase the possibility 
of an attacker discovering a flaw in the PoW algorithim
that would allow him to attack the network by faking work.
Changing security critical components always
introduce significant risk.
The existing PoW algorithim has enjoyed
the benefit of nearly a decade of attack and analysis,
including the identification of vulnerabilities
not discovered until after deployment.

## Speed of commoditization of cutting edge specialty hardware

After years of research and development
bitcoin mining hardware is nearing,
or at,
state of the art with regard to chip design.

If profits continue of specialty hardware makers
competition will increase,
profit margins will decrease,
and we will see commoditization of 
bitcoin mining hardware created using the
height of human ability.

Changing the PoW algorithim would slow this achievement
by several years.


# Effects of the expectation of regular PoW changes 
Creating the expectation of regular PoW changes
would have effects in addition to the effects
resulting from a one-off PoW change.

In this case the uncertainty created by the possibity 
that another PoW change would occur
would be replaced by the reality that 
investing in specialized hardware would 
only be profitable if the cost of development
could be recoverd through sales or mining rewards
before the next expected PoW change.

The motivation for creating this expectation
is to discourage investment into specialized hardware
and therefore to create a "more equal" competition 
among miners with generic and specialized hardware.

In the most extreeme case the PoW changes would 
be so varied and often that 
specialized hardware,
of any kind,
would not be profitable.

## Specialized hardware makers
In all cases specialty hardware makers would remain.
If the variation of mining algorithims is 
expected to be great the speciality hardware makers
could be employees of the miners themselves.
Any changes to the mining algorithim at all
would likely result in disk, memory, cooling or other requirements. 
Optimization of some form will always be present.

If the variation of the mining algorithim is 
expected to vary within a range of possibilities
specialized mining hardware will simply focus on 
the optimal design to address that range of possible algorithims.

However this expectation would be successful
at increasing the amount of uncertainty
for speciality hardware makers
beyond a one-time PoW change.
As a result there will be fewer competitors
all other things (namely profits) being equal.

The net effect of this is that while
a one-off change would delay commoditization
of state of the art specialty mining hardware,
the expectation of regular changes to PoW,
would prevent this from occuring as long as
the expectation was maintained.

## Bitcoin miners
Currently bitcoin miners are primarily concerned
with obtaining cheap electricity 
and access to the best mining hardware available.

Labor costs are currently a minor expense,
but if the PoW algorithim changes often
this will be a greater portion of their expeneses.
This will result in mining operations tending 
to move to areas with cheaper labor costs.

Uncertainty is also increased because
miners will need to account for obtaining 
speciality hardware more often (already a major risk),
and maintaining security in more dangerous areas of the world, 
due to cheaper labor.
Income will also be less certain
as some miners will be better equiped for the next PoW change than others.

As a result miners will invest less 
into securing the bitcoin network
all other things equal.

## Physical and administrative centralization of bitcoin
While it is possible this expectation
would result in greater administrative and 
physical centralization of bitcoin mining,
as in the case of a one-off change,
it is by no means guaranteed,
and we lack a way to determine the liklihood 
that it will be an improvement.







Because the best hardware would be unprofitable only malicous actors would go after it.



If a great majority of the existing mining hardware 
is under the control of a few people,
or is physically located in a small number of places,
a PoW change could result in greater decentralization 
(a larger number of indiviudals with administrative control
and a larger number of physical locations).

This would be a security improvement
because it would make 
physical attacks on the network
and the individuals managing the network,
more more difficult.

## Additional attack vectors
- Such as developers pushing for a mining algo that would benefit a given
miner or a given attacker.

## Verification of PoW
Would be greatly hindered.

## Trustworthiness of PoW
Algorithims would never be fully tested or trustworthy.
