# Effects of a single unexpected PoW change
Making a one-time change to proof of work 
would have different effects 
on different participants in the bitcoin ecosystem. 
Here we are assuming that concerns over centralization
of mining power
and the behavior of miners has created enough concern
to justify a proof of work change 
inorder to destroy the economic value of 
all existing specialized mining hardware.
Proposals to modify proof of work so that the mining hardware
is not completely worthless, but less valuable
will have the same effects,
but in proportion to the economic value removed 
by the change to proof of work.
